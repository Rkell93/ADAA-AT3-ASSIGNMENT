The second objective is therefore to build multiple classifiers that can differentiate exoplanets from other celestial bodies. \n",

        "Given the take-off of machine learning and artificial intelligence over the last decade, it was only a matter of time before it was applied to the data sets compiled by deep-space spacecraft that are photographing and measuring our galaxy and the universe. One such spacecraft, Kepler, has the job of measuring the stellar flux (the amoung of light radiating from a star) over long periods of time. So, when a planet or other celestial object passes between the telescope and the star, there is a drop in the amount of light being radiated from the star momentarily. This therefore creates a drop in a 'light curve' graph. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to be able to detect the momentary decreases in light emission from stars in the hope that they may be caused by exoplanets. \n",

        "Existing Methods\n",

        "In order to solve the problem, researchers have previously a neural network to resolve the problem. A recent success of the application of a neural network on the Kepler Space Telescope data set by NASA led to the discovery of Kepler-90i exolpanet. As NASA (2017) explains, they trained a neural network on a data set of 15,000 previously reviewed light signals from nearby star systems in order to reduce the false positive rate of the algorithm, and then they deployed the algorithm on weaker signals in order to detect more exoplanets in star systems that already had known exoplanets. So, it would be the goal of this project to build several classifiers, average the results of each classifier in order to develop a master classification method with high generalisation. \n",

        "It is the proposal of this project to build three classification algorithms, a Random Forest, XGBoost and a Support Vector Machine. It is the goal of this project to utilise the methodological strengths of tree-based classification algorithms and also the strengths of the non-linear hyperplane separator of the Support Vector Machine in order to gleam different insights from the data set. Such an approach is grounded in the work of Dattilo  et al. (2011), where they built and tested 10 different neural networks, using the same parameters, in order to make predictions on the test set, and therefore average the results of each neural network to arrive at the final predictions on the test set. \n"

        "The significance of this problem concerns the fields of astrophyics and astronomy, two very old and deeply routed fields of scientific enquiry for mankind. Nations have been exploring the cosmos with probes, telescopes and manned missions since the middle of the 20th century and now private companies are taking part in the exploration of the 'last frontier'. So, the discovery of, and learnings about, new planets in our galaxy could lead to developments in our understanding celestial bodies, what the probability is of other Earth-like planets existing in our galaxy is, and whether or not there is other life the Milky Way Galaxy/the universe. \n",

        "Over the 9 year lifespan of the telescopes operation, NASA would periodically release the data that Kepler had collected on the 150,000 stars that it was monitoring for the duration. Since Kepler was decomissioned at the end of 2018, NASA has just released another large data set which gives thr public the chance to analyse the data to potentially find new exoplanets orbiting the 150,000 stars observed. So, the interest in the project is the potential to discover a new planet. \n",

Since this will be a supervised machine learning classification task, the following algorithms will be designed with the same variables, on the same training set, and the results of the three algorithms will be averaged to yield a composite-master classification model;\n",
