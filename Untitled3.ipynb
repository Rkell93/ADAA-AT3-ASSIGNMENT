The second objective is therefore to build multiple classifiers that can differentiate exoplanets from other celestial bodies. \n",

        "Given the take-off of machine learning and artificial intelligence over the last decade, it was only a matter of time before it was applied to the data sets compiled by deep-space spacecraft that are photographing and measuring our galaxy and the universe. One such spacecraft, Kepler, has the job of measuring the stellar flux (the amoung of light radiating from a star) over long periods of time. So, when a planet or other celestial object passes between the telescope and the star, there is a drop in the amount of light being radiated from the star momentarily. This therefore creates a drop in a 'light curve' graph. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to be able to detect the momentary decreases in light emission from stars in the hope that they may be caused by exoplanets. \n",

        "In order to solve the problem, researchers have previously a neural network to resolve the problem. A recent success of the application of a neural network on the Kepler Space Telescope data set by NASA led to the discovery of Kepler-90i exolpanet. As NASA (2017) explains, they trained a neural network on a data set of 15,000 previously reviewed light signals from nearby star systems in order to reduce the false positive rate of the algorithm, and then they deployed the algorithm on weaker signals in order to detect more exoplanets in star systems that already had known exoplanets. \n",
